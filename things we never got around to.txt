Navy Strike CIS 150 Erik, Tristan and Chuck

Features that we wanted to get to but didnt have the time to get around to 


Let the player adjust the colors on the game board through options. 
setting a boolean in options and sending that to our game board in an if else chain could of changed how the board looked for the user.


Using the fstream that was demoed in class for a score board, we we're not sure what to base score off of though.
Time doesn't really matter for a strategic game like this, but how many missiles you used up might.


A way to disable / enable the intro from options and not let it play the next time it was opened up, right into the menu.

I was considering using the background color code that was provided by Mr.Moore to highlight when a user selected a letter row
and a number row, to show how far from the selected spot on the board a specific ship could go. This has complications with overlap,
and going off the board.


******************   Really far out their ideas   ******************


Change the size of the board and amount of ships that could be placed


Real back and forth of two player with swapping turns and placing ships for both players.


Different modes of how to play the game
like giving player one mines to place down along with their ships, lets say player one gets 5-7 mines.
Player two will get a max hp modifier lets say 5 hearts and if player two hits too many mines theirs another way of losing the
game instead of running out of missiles

Clock runs out, if the clock runs out of time the ships leave and if any ship leaves before being destroyed then you lose the game
if you kill the ships before the clock runs out add the remaining time to a modifier to the score.

*******************  ABILITIES  ***************************
A feature called Odins Eye which is a scanner 3x3 reveal of the board.

Repair damaged ship mechanic (replenish or fully heal a ship)

Move a ship on the fly

Orbital Bombardment 3x3 missile launch

These could be used once a game or x amount of turns

****************  Ship Behaviour  *********************

I was thinking of a (helicopter, row-boat or air ship) that would slowly move across the board.
it would only take up one place so it would be possible to take out, and only move to places that have not been fired upon
 or where another ship is at. So every x amount of turns it would move its place to another random blank spot.
